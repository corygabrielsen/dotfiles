# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles and configurations for various
tools and applications.

## Contents

- `apt-get`: List of package dependencies.
- `git`: Git configuration files and hooks.
- `tmux`: TMUX configuration files.
- `vim`: Vim configuration files.
- `zsh`: Z shell configuration files.

## Installation

To install these dotfiles, clone the repository and run the `install.sh` script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```

This will create symlinks for the dotfiles in the repository, linking them to
the appropriate locations in your home directory.

# Customization

Feel free to use and customize these dotfiles as you see fit. If you make any
improvements or changes that you think would be useful to others, please
